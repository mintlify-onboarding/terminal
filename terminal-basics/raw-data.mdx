title: "Raw Data"
---
## Overview
Many of Terminal's endpoints support a `raw` parameter that enables you to retreive the underlying raw data used to form the common model. This can helpful in scenarios when a provider includes very unique fields that may not fit in to a unified model.

### Considerations
It's important to note that using the `raw` parameter will impact response times and should only be used in scenarios where it is necessary.

If you plan to use `raw`, please let us know as we are always curious to hear about gaps in our common model that might be roadmap opportunities.


## Usage
When making a `GET` call to a supported endpoint, set the `raw` query parameter to `true` and retreive the common model as well as an additional `raw` property that includes the most recent list of raw responses used to form the common model.

### Example Response
Here's an example of a request to `/vehicles/{id}?raw=true`

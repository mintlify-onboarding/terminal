title: "Passthrough"
---
With Terminal's authenticated passthrough request, direct requests to an integration's API can be made.

Terminal simplifies API requests to any of the integrations supported by Terminal using the account tokens you've stored on behalf of your users. The requests are transmitted directly to the API of the integration and adhere to the specific API formats of each integration, not Terminal's standardized format. This approach is useful if you want to retrieve data that Terminal may not make requests for.

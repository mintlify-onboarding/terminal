title: "Resource Expansion"
---

Some of Terminal's endpoints feature an `expand` parameter that allows you to expand nested resources. This helps you get straight to the data you're looking for in less requests.

## Example 

As an example, if you are calling an expandable endpoint that includes the following relationship:
```json
{
  "vehicle": "vcl_01GSKTHKXVVS2EKE6MP0N20YPE"
}
```
By providing `expand=vehicle` in the request you can expand the field to include all details:
```json
{
  "vehicle": {
    "id": "vcl_01GSKTHKXVVS2EKE6MP0N20YPE",
    "vin": "12345"
    // ... other vehicle properties
  }
}
```

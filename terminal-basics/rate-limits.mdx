## Global Rate Limits

Every endpoint enforces the following rate limits:

- **Per Connection**
    - Each connection token may make **100 API requests per second**
- **Per Application**
    - Each application may make **200 API requests per second**

This means that if you have multiple connections, you may make up to 100 requests per second per connection with a maximum of 200 requests per second across all connections.


## Handling Rate Limit Errors

When you exceed the rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` error. The response body will contain a `Retry-After` header with the number of seconds you should wait before retrying the request.

### Example
```json
HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
Retry-After: 0.62
Content-Type: application/json
Body: {
  "message": "Too Many Requests",
  "detail": "API rate limit exceeded - please try again in 0.62 s"
}
```

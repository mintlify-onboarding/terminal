## Overview

When authenticating with Terminal there are 3 main types of credentials you need to know about. This guide will provide an overview of each and where you use them.

### Secret Key

The secret key is used to authenticate requests to Terminal's API. Get it from your Dashboard or the Terminal team.

<Warning>
Your secret key should never be shared publicly as it will grant access to all of yours and your customer's data
</Warning>

**Usage**

All API calls to Terminal should include the following header:

```
Authorization: Bearer SECRET_KEY
```

### Connection Token
Connection tokens tell Terminal which connection you would like to make the API request on behalf of. These are generated during the [linking flow]().

**Usage**

All API calls to Terminal requesting customer data on behalf of a connection should include the following header.
```
Connection-Token: CONNECTION_TOKEN
```

### Publishable Key
The publishable key is used to identify your application during the link flow. This key is intended to be shared publically from your client or shared links.

**Usage**

Append the publishable key to the link URL when directing users to create a connection.
```
https://link.withterminal.com/?key=PUBLISHABLE_KEY
```

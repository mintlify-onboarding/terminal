## What is Terminal?

Terminal makes integrating with telematics and ELDs dramatically easier. We provide a single unified API to consistently sync normalized data from multiple third-party telematics service providers (TSPs).

## Concepts

### Common Model

To simplify development, all data is standardized to meet a common model. This allows you to think of all of your customer's data through the same lens - enabling multiple integrations with a fraction of the develoment effort.

### Account Linking

We provide a simple [link](/link) component that can be embedded in your application. This helps to standardize authentication across all of your integrations. Allow Terminal to worry about the difference between given vendors while you focus on the core product features built on top of this data.

### Connections

After a customer succesfuly links their TSP account, a `Connection` is created. Connections have settings to control the frequency and access permissions to a given TSP account. As part of the link flow, you are provided with a connection token that you must provide to access this customer's data.

### Telematics Service Provider (TSP)

TSPs are the platforms that provide fleets with telematics devices and related software. Some popular examples of TSPs include Samsara, Motive or Geotab.

### Electronic Logging Devices (ELD)

Electronic Logging Devices (ELD) are a specific class of telematics device that support tracking a drivers hours of service (HOS).

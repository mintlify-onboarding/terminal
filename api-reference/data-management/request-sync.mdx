By default, Terminal will sync all connections where `syncMode = automatic` on a regular cadence. For customers that may not need a fleet's data to be kept up to date and want to reduce their active tracked trucks, you can set `syncMode = manual` and invoke this endpoint when you want to sync data.

If you're wondering if this is relevent to your use case then feel free to reach out and we'd be happy to assist.
